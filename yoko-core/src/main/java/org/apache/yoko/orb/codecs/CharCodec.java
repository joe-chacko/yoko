/**
 * Java's native character support uses UTF-16.
 * This interface supports encoding from and to a specific wire format.
 * The general contract is to encode everything possible, and to replace characters that cannot be encoded/decoded
 * with the Unicode replacement character, '\uFFFD', wherever possible.
 * This Unicode character is not supported by any of the single-byte encodings, such as US-ASCII or ISO-8859-7.
 * When encoding to such an encoding, a replacement character of '?' (question mark) will be used instead.
 * The reason for replacement rather than throwing an exception is that the text may not be critical and
 * forcing a failure would be unnecessarily restrictive.
 * <p>
 *     There are some error conditions to do with variable multibyte encodings, such as UTF-8.
 *     When decoding these, there are certain illegal sequences of bytes that cannot be interpreted as UTF-8.
 *     These will be treated as undecodable characters and replaced as detailed above.
 *     It may not be possible to determine how many characters were intended,
 *     and the number of replacement characters for a corrupted encoding may vary.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Certain Unicode codepoints are represented in UTF-16 by pairs of "surrogate" characters.
 *     Where these can be encoded directly, e.g. when encoding to UTF-16, they will be encoded verbatim
 *     even when the sequence does not make sense. There are operating systems that allow filenames ending
 *     in an unmatched surrogate character, and it may be necessary to transmit these "illegal" strings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When encoding surrogates to UTF-8, however, there is no permitted encoding that directly matches a
 *     single surrogate character. The correct approach is to consider the pair together,
 *     determine the intended codepoint, and encode that as a 4-byte UTF-8 encoded character.
 *     If a high surrogate is written, it will be buffered until the matching low surrogate arrives.
 *     If the {@link #assertNoBufferedCharData()} method is invoked when an unmatched surrogate has been written,
 *     this method will throw a DATA_CONVERSION exception, indicating that the characters provided could not be encoded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When decoding surrogates from UTF-8, two characters may be decoded at once. Since this interface is
 *     character-oriented, only a single character will be returned. The next call the {@link #readChar(ReadBuffer)}
 *     will return the buffered second surrogate. The cursor in the {@link ReadBuffer} will not be moved to the end of
 *     the 4-byte sequence until the second character is consumed.
 *     If the {@link #assertNoBufferedCharData()} method is invoked when a low surrogate is waiting to be read,
 *     this method will throw a DATA_CONVERSION exception, indicating that characters were not read completely.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     UTF-8's built-in error detectability also allows for "overlong" encodings. This is where a multibyte sequence is
 *     used to encode a codepoint that belonged in a shorter encoding. This represents a security risk, since it can
 *     potentially be used to sneak characters past validation (consider injection attacks) or to spoof another string
 *     with a different string that displays the same (consider URL spoofing). The desired behaviour is to decode these
 *     prohibited overlong encodings as the Unicode replacement character, '\uFFFD'.
 * </p>
